# Problem Description 
Pretend you are the owner/operator of a emergency healthcare clinic needing to build a
relational database. You hired some students from the MIST 4610 class at the University of
Georgia to create the database for you. They need to know more about your organization to
identify which entities, attributes, and relationships are important for you. Start by describing
your business as a real client.
